Hi, I'm TheConnMan, aka Brian Conn.

I'm a full-stack software developer in the DC area currently working for a large federal IT contractor. Over the past few years I've mainly built quick, small web applications using tools like Grails running on AWS infrastructure. Recently I've been working towards improving the reliability and quality of the applications while retaining the speed and agility of development. Most apps I help build are researched, built, and operated by a small team or by myself, so I focus on finding tools and processes which help me build systems with as little code as possible.

I also work with project teams within the company I work for to help them improve their software development capabilities. This means identifying and improving use of source control, testing, automation, requirements tracking, continuous integration/deployment, and many other topics.

Outside of work I'm usually looking at some new technology, reading, or finding new music.
